# Pydantic for Data Validation

## Introduction
[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) is a powerful Python library for **data validation** and **serialization**. It helps ensure that user-defined models maintain **type safety**, provide built-in validation, and enable seamless integration with web applications, APIs, and backend services. 

This repository contains structured **Pydantic models**, demonstrating various use cases such as user authentication, nested data validation, computed properties, and enforcing constraints like required fields, type validation, and minimum values.

## ðŸ”¥ Why Use Pydantic?
- **Automatic Validation**: Ensures data integrity by enforcing type constraints.
- **Type Annotations**: Uses Python's `typing` module for clarity.
- **Serialization & Parsing**: Converts complex data into structured objects.
- **Error Handling**: Provides **detailed error messages** for debugging.
- **Nested Models**: Supports validation of hierarchical data structures.
